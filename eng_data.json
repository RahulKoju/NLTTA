According to expedition details, Ushakov flew from New York to Kathmandu, and then to Everest Base Camp before beginning the climb.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He utilized hypoxic training for acclimatization ahead of the journey, reportedly spending over 400 hours in a hypoxic tent. The team assisting Ushakov included guides Tejan Gurung, Pur Bahadur Gurung, Bidhan Shrestha, Sujal Gurung, KiTemba Sherpa, and Pemba Chhewang Sherpa, alongside porters, kitchen staff, and base camp crew.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ushakov’s climb took place during the regular spring climbing window on Everest. Unlike traditional expeditions that span over a month due to extended acclimatization, his approach was built around rapid ascent strategies. He used bottled oxygen during the climb and adhered to safety protocols, as per the expedition company.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ushakov had previously attempted a similar feat in 2024 but turned back due to vision issues and deteriorating weather. During that attempt, he crossed paths with mountaineer Nirmal ‘Nims’ Purja, who later became involved in planning Ushakov’s 2025 climb through his guiding company.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ushakov, who began high-altitude climbing in 2020, stated that the effort was not intended to break existing records but to test the limits of human endurance under controlled and supported conditions. The current record for fastest round-trip (sea level to summit and back) is held by Roxanne Vogel, who completed it in 14 days in 2019.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In 2025, Ushakov had recently recovered from serious injuries sustained during an avalanche in Ecuador. He was medically cleared to climb Everest after a period of rehabilitation. Additional precautions were reportedly taken during the climb to address health and safety concerns stemming from those injuries.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Following the summit, Ushakov expressed interest in attempting K2, the world’s second-highest mountain. He acknowledged the role of his guiding team in making the ascent possible, citing their contingency planning and support.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While Ushakov’s ascent is not officially certified as a speed record by climbing regulatory bodies, the expedition adds to a growing trend of rapid ascents using logistics-heavy, oxygen-assisted climbing models.</p>",

        "content": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">KATHMANDU: On May 21, 2025, a dramatic intervention by the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) laid bare a festering issue within Nepal’s immigration and airport system. Tirtha Raj Bhattarai, a Joint Secretary at the Home Ministry who had just been transferred from his post as Chief Immigration Officer at Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA), was arrested after a raid by the CIAA.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The anti-graft agency, acting on multiple complaints, found substantial evidence suggesting Bhattarai&#8217;s involvement in a human trafficking ring. Electronic devices were confiscated, and early indications pointed to the illegal facilitation of foreign travel in exchange for money. This high-profile arrest turned the spotlight once again on the deep-rooted corruption and lax oversight that have plagued Nepal’s international gateway for years.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>TIA as a gateway for illicit activities</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Tribhuvan International Airport has long served not only as a vital infrastructural asset but also as a convenient node for various forms of organized criminal activities. Time and again, major scandals have broken out involving the illegal passage of gold, foreign currency, and even people. The airport, which should be a symbol of national integrity and security, has increasingly become synonymous with impunity and collusion among officials.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In July 2023, one of the biggest gold smuggling operations in recent memory was uncovered when authorities seized around 100 kilograms of gold concealed inside motorcycle brake shoes. The smuggled consignment, which had passed through TIA’s customs without detection, was later intercepted outside the airport premises. Several individuals were arrested, including a Chinese national and three Nepali accomplices. The incident starkly exposed the failure of security protocols at the customs desk and hinted at internal complicity in allowing such contraband to slip through the system.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Such cases are not new. Back in January 2017, another massive gold smuggling attempt was foiled when the Central Investigation Bureau of Nepal Police seized 33 kilograms of gold from a passenger arriving from the UAE. The gold had already passed customs undetected and was only intercepted when the suspect was about to leave the airport premises. These cases illustrate that TIA’s vulnerabilities are not occasional lapses but symptoms of a chronic ailment.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Institutionalized corruption and administrative complicity</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What emerges from the recurring scandals is not merely incompetence but systemic rot. The arrest of Tirtha Raj Bhattarai, a senior government official, underscores how high-level functionaries are not just negligent but allegedly complicit.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Such involvement from the top echelons suggests a deeply entrenched network of collusion that renders enforcement ineffective. Bribes, protection rackets, and silence in the face of illegality have become institutionalized, compromising the integrity of immigration services and security operations.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The frequent rotation of officials, ostensibly for reform, appears more cosmetic than corrective. Rather than breaking entrenched nexuses, these transfers often serve to shield accused officials from deeper investigation or allow them to restart their activities under a different title. There is a glaring lack of accountability and a near-total absence of preventive mechanisms.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Failures in customs</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The ease with which contraband, particularly gold, bypasses customs inspection at TIA is alarming. Gold smuggling, while lucrative, poses a direct threat to Nepal’s financial system, undermining its foreign exchange reserves and destabilizing the formal market.  That such activities continue despite occasional crackdowns indicates that the security apparatus is either overwhelmed or compromised—or both.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Customs officers are the first line of defense against transnational crimes. Yet, time and again, customs checks have failed to intercept illicit goods. In many instances, it is only through external tip-offs or chance that smuggled items are seized. This reactive posture highlights a deficiency in the systemic design of airport security protocols. Surveillance, profiling, baggage checks, and human intelligence all appear to be inadequately deployed or effectively circumvented.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Collusion among stakeholders</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The repeated scandals at TIA reveal a broader network of complicity involving a range of actors—from customs officials to security personnel and, increasingly, high-ranking bureaucrats. The alleged embezzlement in the perimeter lighting project at TIA further supports this theory.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In September 2024, the CIAA launched a probe into the installation of security lights worth around Rs 20 million. The investigation found that over half the allocated funds were embezzled, with the installed lights deemed substandard.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This kind of procurement fraud reflects a different but equally damaging aspect of TIA&#8217;s governance crisis. It shows how airport resources, intended for enhancing safety and security, are instead siphoned off through corrupt practices. When officials tasked with securing the airport infrastructure are themselves involved in fraudulent schemes, the ramifications are widespread—from safety lapses to broader reputational damage.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Inadequate accountability mechanisms</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While the CIAA and law enforcement agencies have occasionally intervened, such actions have mostly been reactive. Investigations typically follow tip-offs, media exposure, or public outcry. There is a clear absence of institutionalized oversight or internal audit systems that can proactively detect or deter wrongdoing.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Moreover, even when arrests are made or goods are seized, the legal consequences for those involved tend to be limited. Cases drag on for years, and many accused walk free or return to government service without serious repercussions. This lack of consequences creates a culture of impunity, where the benefits of engaging in corruption outweigh the risks. Until there is a credible threat of detection and punishment, deterrence will remain weak.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The political economy of TIA corruption</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Tribhuvan International Airport is not just a transportation hub; it is also a site of significant political and economic interest. Various stakeholders politicians, bureaucrats, contractors, and even international actors—see the airport as a lucrative zone for rent-seeking.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The overlapping jurisdictions and interests make it difficult to enforce a singular, cohesive regulatory framework. Political protection often shields corrupt officials, while regulatory bodies are rendered toothless.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Furthermore, the centralization of power in Kathmandu ensures that TIA remains under direct political patronage. Appointments to key positions, such as immigration officers or customs chiefs, are frequently influenced by political considerations rather than merit or expertise. As a result, administrative efficiency takes a backseat to political loyalty, further exacerbating the governance crisis.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>International implications and reputational risk</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The ongoing irregularities at TIA have consequences beyond Nepal’s borders. As the country’s main functioning international airport, its failings affect global perceptions of Nepal’s governance and institutional integrity. Foreign travelers, international airlines, diplomatic missions, and multilateral agencies all pass through TIA. When it is perceived as insecure or corrupt, the entire nation’s credibility suffers.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In particular, the ease with which human trafficking operations have allegedly been facilitated at the airport is deeply concerning. Nepal is already under international scrutiny for its vulnerabilities to trafficking and labor exploitation. When state officials are found to be complicit, it undermines efforts by civil society, NGOs, and even foreign governments that are working to curb such abuses. It also jeopardizes Nepal’s standing in global human rights assessments and aviation safety rankings.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The role of reform and the need for structural overhaul</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Superficial fixes will not address the deep-rooted problems afflicting TIA. What is needed is a structural overhaul of governance mechanisms, supported by robust legal and institutional reforms.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This includes establishing an independent airport oversight body with real enforcement powers, implementing real-time surveillance and tracking systems, and ensuring merit-based appointments at every level.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Procurement processes must be digitized and made transparent to prevent embezzlement and collusion. Staff at customs, immigration, and security must undergo regular training, and those found guilty of misconduct should face swift and proportionate penalties. Whistleblower protections need to be strengthened to encourage internal reporting of malpractices. Above all, there must be political will to insulate TIA from undue influence and interference.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>A litmus test for governance reform</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The repeated irregularities at Tribhuvan International Airport are not isolated mishaps but indicators of a broader governance failure. From human trafficking and gold smuggling to embezzlement of infrastructure funds, the range and frequency of scandals point to a deeply compromised institutional culture.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While agencies like the CIAA have intervened sporadically, their efforts remain insufficient without a comprehensive strategy to tackle systemic rot.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">TIA’s fate is emblematic of the challenges facing Nepal’s public sector more broadly. Unless addressed urgently and decisively, these failures will continue to erode public trust, hamper economic development, and tarnish the country’s international reputation.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Reforming TIA is not just about fixing an airport—it is about reaffirming the state’s capacity to govern with integrity and purpose.</p>",

Even the reactionary forces he’s sided with don’t trust him anymore,” said Prachanda.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Reacting to these remarks, Rekhi Gurung posted a sharp rebuttal on social media, calling Prachanda’s comment and persona &#8220;two great political jokes.&#8221; “‘To say Baburam lacks intelligence and to regard Prachanda as a true communist’ are, in themselves, two grand political jokes,” Gurung wrote.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gurung reminded readers that if Dr. Bhattarai had not vacated his Gorkha constituency, Prachanda might never have made it to Parliament. “In that sense, I’ve met and heard from many Gorkhali people who consider Baburam to be naïve—but certainly not unintelligent,” he added.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He also pointed out the irony in Prachanda ridiculing Bhattarai while enjoying the legacy of Bhattarai’s contributionsspecifically, the Mid-Hill Highway, a national pride project conceptualized by Bhattarai.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Mocking Baburam while taking a morning walk along the Mid-Hill Highway is nothing less than laughing at one’s own history,” Gurung wrote. Drawing a deeper contrast between the two leaders, Gurung asserted:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“If Prachanda is a political player, Baburam is a carrier of ideological transformation. A person lives for a time, but ideas are eternal. That is the difference between the individual and the ideology.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He concluded his statement with a scathing remark on the current state of Nepal’s politics: “Nepali politics has become a comedy show. Thank you, comrade, for today’s dose of humor.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This exchange underscores the widening rift between two key figures of Nepal’s Maoist movement, once allies during the decade-long insurgency and early phases of republican transition, but now sharply divided both ideologically and personally.</p>\n<p>Also Read:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><p><a href=\"https://nepalnews.com/s/politics/cpn-maoist-centre-chair-dahal-in-rukum-east/\">Prachanda calls Baburam Bhattarai a national joke</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>",

With the destruction of wetland areas for cultivation, the habitat of the cranes has been shrinking each passing year. This means that the food for the birds has also been dwindling.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to Hirulal Dagaura, an ornithologist at the Nepal Bird Conservation Society, the existence of this bird is in danger due to farmers increasingly using chemical fertilizers along with pesticides for farming.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The hunting of the Sarus, stealing its eggs, along with climate change and environmental pollution, has created additional risks.

In this way cranes help control insects and pest infestation in crops, but recently it has been observed that this bird itself is facing an existential crisis.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When ferocious animals like tigers, leopards, foxes, and wild boars come nearby, this bird alerts with a loud call. Therefore, the crane is also considered a human-friendly bird. This bird, according to ornithologist Dagaura, relies on paddy fields and wetlands to make its nest and feed.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“But in recent days, it is hardly possible to see this bird here. Therefore, it is essential for the municipality and local communities to pay special attention to protecting wetland areas. Along with the importance of this bird, awareness about its habits, behavior, and habitat should be raised to involve local residents in conservation efforts,” he said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Experts suggest that it is necessary to encourage farmers to promote the use of organic fertilizers and organic pesticides while discouraging the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides in agriculture.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Sarus crane is listed as a protected bird under the National Park and Wildlife Conservation Act 2029, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has included it in the list of vulnerable species.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to statistics, there are more than 600 Sarus cranes only in Rupandehi, Kapilbastu, and Nawalparasi.

        "content": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">KATHMANDU: The Gopal Dynasty holds a revered place in the annals of Nepalese history as the earliest recorded dynasty to have ruled the land now known as Nepal.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Rooted deeply in mythology, folklore, and tradition, the story of the Gopals is intertwined with religious symbolism and the gradual transformation of Nepal from a wilderness into an organized civilization. The very name &#8220;Gopal&#8221; translates to &#8220;Cowherd,&#8221; signifying their pastoral beginnings and connection with agrarian life.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This dynasty, belonging to the Nip Clan, is believed to have arrived from the Indian subcontinent alongside the divine figure of Lord Krishna. Their legacy includes establishing political authority, cultural institutions, and religious landmarks that shaped Nepal’s early civilization.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>From the Indian Plains to the Himalayan Valleys</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Historical narratives suggest that the Gopals migrated from the western Indian regions near the Saraswati River, crossing the mighty Gandaki River, before settling in the Kathmandu Valley. This migration is shrouded in myth, particularly the belief that the Gopals came alongside Lord Krishna, who helped them defeat the indigenous tribes known as the Danasur and Naga. These tribes were said to have terrorized the valley, and their defeat marked the beginning of Gopal sovereignty.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Before their arrival, the Kathmandu Valley was famously a large lake, known as Nagdaha. According to legend, it was drained by the Bodhisattva Manjushree, who carved out the valley&#8217;s fertile land by cutting the gorge at Chovar. Manjushree also appointed Dharmakar as the first king, setting an initial framework of governance. The Gopals’ arrival postdates this event and marks the transition from mythic landscape formation to the start of dynastic rule.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Bhumi Gupta and the Role of Saint Ne</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A central story recounts how Bhumi Gupta, the first king of the Gopal Dynasty, ascended the throne. This tale reflects the interplay between divine sanction and mortal leadership. A cow named Brahuri, belonging to the Gopal community, reportedly came daily to the banks of the Bagmati River to offer milk at a mysterious spot. When a local leader investigated, he was mysteriously struck down by a Jyotirlinga  a radiant manifestation of Lord Shiva’s presence. This sacred occurrence led the saint Ne (Ne Muni), who was meditating nearby, to intervene. Ne took Bhumi Gupta, the son of the slain leader, under his protection and declared him the rightful king of Nepal.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This legend is significant in illustrating the divine approval required to govern Nepal, emphasizing that spiritual blessing preceded political power. Saint Ne’s role as kingmaker underscores a religious foundation to early governance, where rulers were not mere conquerors but also custodians of divine will.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Absolute Monarchy and Territorial Control</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Gopal Dynasty established a form of absolute monarchy, where the king wielded supreme authority over political, religious, and social affairs. Bhumi Gupta, the first monarch, chose Mata Tirtha — a site approximately four miles southwest of modern Kathmandu  as the capital city. This choice reflects a strategic and symbolic positioning near vital rivers and fertile land.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Territorially, the Gopal realm was centered around the Kathmandu Valley but extended to natural borders: the Dudh Koshi River to the east, Trishuli River to the west, Gosainkunda Lake in the north, and Chitlang in the south. This territorial extent allowed them to control important trade routes and fertile agricultural lands.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Administration was likely rudimentary but effective, with village-level settlements governed by local chieftains or clan leaders loyal to the monarch. These communities were engaged primarily in agriculture and animal husbandry, sustaining the kingdom’s economy and enabling social stability.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, and Early Trade</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As the name Gopal (&#8220;cowherd&#8221;) indicates, animal husbandry was a cornerstone of the dynasty’s economy. Cattle rearing, particularly cows, was both a practical livelihood and a cultural symbol, intertwined with Hindu religious practice.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Agriculture flourished in the newly reclaimed fertile lands of the Kathmandu Valley. The draining of the lake and clearing of dense forests allowed the Gopals to establish permanent settlements, cultivate crops, and support growing populations. Crops such as barley, millet, and rice would have been staples, complemented by fruit orchards and vegetable gardens.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trade was emerging but still limited. The valley&#8217;s location along early Himalayan trade routes meant that the Gopals likely engaged in exchanges of goods such as salt, herbs, and possibly precious stones with neighboring tribes and regions. This economic activity contributed to gradual wealth accumulation and cultural exchange.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Shaivism and the Discovery of Pashupatinath</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Gopal kings were devout followers of Shaivism, a major sect of Hinduism that worships Lord Shiva as the supreme deity. This religious orientation influenced their cultural expressions, rituals, and governance.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of the most enduring legacies attributed to the Gopal Dynasty is the discovery of the Pashupatinath Temple, now one of Nepal’s most sacred Hindu sites and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. According to tradition, the Jyotirlinga that appeared during the cow Brahuri’s milk offering was the very manifestation of Lord Shiva known as Pashupatinath. The temple became a center of pilgrimage and spiritual life for the valley’s inhabitants and beyond.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Apart from Shaivism, some members of the Gopal community practiced Vaishnavism, devotion to Lord Krishna, reflecting the dynasty’s mythical ties to Krishna and the Indian subcontinent.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Art and Architecture</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Although tangible archaeological evidence from the Gopal period is scarce, traditional accounts suggest that the dynasty initiated early forms of artistic and architectural expression. The establishment of religious sites such as Pashupatinath implies the construction of early temple structures, which would have been modest compared to later stone temples but significant for their symbolic value.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Artistic expressions likely included ritual objects, pottery, and symbolic carvings linked to Shaivite worship. The Gopals’ pastoral lifestyle also influenced their material culture — from cattle decorations to household implements — blending utility with spiritual meaning.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Expanding the Gopal Influence</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Gopal Dynasty’s rule extended beyond the capital, with settlements spread across several regions surrounding the Kathmandu Valley. Places like Kirtipur, Thankot, Balambu, Tistung, Palung, Sakhu, Manichud, and Changu became important habitations under their governance. These communities contributed to the dynasty’s socio-economic base and cultural cohesion.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Social organization was likely clan-based, with extended families working communal lands and participating in collective rituals. The Gopals’ focus on agriculture and cattle rearing necessitated cooperation among families and clans, creating a social fabric grounded in shared labor and religious observance.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The Eight Kings of the Gopal Dynasty: Chronology and Reign</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The dynasty’s recorded history includes eight kings who ruled over a combined period ranging from approximately 436 to 521 years, depending on varying sources. These monarchs consolidated political power, expanded settlements, and reinforced religious institutions.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Bhumi Gupta: The first king and founder, ruling roughly 84–86 years, established the monarchy and capital at Mata Tirtha.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dharma (or Param) Gupta: The second monarch, credited with further stabilizing the kingdom, ruled about 91 years.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Bhim Gupta: Ruled for 34 to 38 years; maintained and expanded agricultural practices.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Bishnu Gupta: A ruler for 46 years, possibly responsible for strengthening religious traditions.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Jaya Gupta: Ruled for 73 years; his reign marked by consolidation of power.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Harsha Gupta: King for 67 years; further developed settlements and governance.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mani (or Mati) Gupta: Ruled 37 years; may have introduced administrative reforms.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Jita (or Yaksha) Gupta: The last king, ruling for about 70 years, under whom the dynasty eventually ended.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While the exact dates remain debated, these kings represent a lineage that shaped Nepal’s early political and cultural identity.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The End of the Gopal Dynasty</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The dynasty’s decline culminated with King Jita Gupta, who reportedly died childless. This succession crisis left a power vacuum that was soon filled by the Abhirs or Mahispals, a group traditionally known as buffalo herders, who overthrew the Gopals and founded the Mahispal Dynasty.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This transition marks a symbolic shift in Nepal’s early history — from cowherders to buffalo herders — and reflects the dynamic nature of tribal and clan politics in the region. It also underscores the fragile nature of dynastic continuity in early Himalayan polities.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Foundations of Nepal’s Identity</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Though historical and archaeological proof of the Gopal Dynasty remains limited and often mingled with legend, their impact on Nepalese identity is profound. They represent the beginning of monarchy in Nepal, laying the groundwork for successive dynasties that ruled the valley.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The dynasty’s contributions to religious life, particularly through Pashupatinath Temple, continue to resonate. Their political model of kingship, territorial control, and settlement patterns set precedents followed by later rulers.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The name “Nepal” itself is traditionally linked to the Gopal era, with “Ne” referring to the divine protector and “Pal” meaning protector or herder — collectively symbolizing the land guarded by sacred authority.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Myth, Memory, and the Birth of a Nation</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Gopal Dynasty stands at the crossroads of myth and history. While modern scholarship treats much of their story as legend, their narrative remains central to Nepal’s cultural memory. They embody the archetype of early rulers who transformed a wild landscape into a settled kingdom, united religious devotion with political power, and founded institutions that shaped Nepal’s unique civilization.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In embracing both their mythic grandeur and historical mystery, the story of the Gopals invites us to explore Nepal’s origins not merely as a sequence of events but as a vibrant tapestry of faith, power, and community — a legacy that continues to inspire the nation today.</p>",

        "content": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">KATHMANDU: At a recent kulpuja in my family, I watched as male Brahmin priests conducted every ritual, their voices chanting mantras while women sat on the sidelines preparing offerings or serving food.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When my cousin who was a girl, cracked a coconut as prasad and offered it to a priest, he recoiled saying, “Keti le chadaunu hudaina” (a girl shouldn’t offer it) I was stunned. This wasn’t just a rejection of her gesture, it was a rejection of her place in a sacred space.</p>\n<p>The kulpuja incident is not isolated. In Nepal, religious rituals whether Hindu pujas or other ceremonies are overwhelmingly led by men. At my family’s kulpuja, every Brahmin priests were males, the old traditions that reserve spiritual authority for men. Hindu texts like the Manusmriti historically limit women’s access to Vedic rituals framing them as impure or unfit to lead.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A 2024 study by the Nepal Women’s Association found that 95% of registered priests in Hindu temples across Nepal are male despite no legal barrier to women’s participation.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The priest’s refusal to accept my cousin’s prasad dismissing her offering with “Keti le chadaunu hudaina” is a microcosm of this exclusion. The phrase implies that a woman’s touch or agency taints the sacred. For instance, 32 year old Radhika Sharma, a female priest trained in 2023 told The Kathmandu Post, “People are shocked when I lead a puja. They think only men can speak to God.”</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This male monopoly on spirituality not only excludes women but also devalues their spiritual worth reinforcing their subordination in both religious and social spheres.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This patriarchal mindset extends beyond rituals to everyday interactions. When my father proudly says “Euta chori, Euta chori” when they ask about the children they have, the inevitable response “Chora chaina?” reveals a cultural obsession with sons.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This question asked casually but loaded with expectation reflects a society that sees daughters as lesser their value tied to marriage rather than their own potential. This preference has real consequence, a 2024 case in Dang saw a woman Saraswati, pressured into multiple pregnancies by her in-laws to produce a male heir enduring verbal abuse for “failing.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When women defy these norms by speaking out they face character assassination. A young activist Maya, used ‘X’ to critique dowry practices in Biratnagar. Her posts were flooded with comments calling her arrogant, unmarriageable or disrespectful to tradition.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This mirrors historical patterns where women’s voices were curtailed through ideals like pativrata which glorifies silent, obedient wives. Today outspoken women like Onsari Gharti Magar, Nepal’s first female Speaker of Parliament, face media scrutiny over their personal lives rather than their achievements.</p>\n<p>Even in progressive and educative households where both parents work, women bear the brunt of domestic labor. A 2023 WOREC study found that 78% of working women in urban Nepal spend 3-5 hours daily on unpaid domestic work compared to less than an hour for men.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This inequity is rooted in marriage’s patriarchal structure. Rituals like ‘Kanyadan’ where a bride is “given” to her husband’s family set the tone for a lifetime of service. Serials like Sajha Sawal glorify women who juggle careers and kitchens framing it as empowerment while ignoring the exhaustion.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Male dominated rituals, son preference, silenced voices and unequal labor are rooted in Nepal’s patriarchal traditions. Divorce carries stigma for women but not men. When singer Eleena Chauhan filed for divorce against Bishnu Sapkota in January 2025 at Kathmandu District Court citing suspicion and character attacks, the flood of negative comments on her social media wasn’t surprising.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Films like Prem Geet romanticize women’s sacrifice while real life women who defy norms like my cousin or Maya are punished. The reel life myth of harmonious traditions clashes with the real life reality of exclusion and inequity leaving women to navigate a society that devalues them from the altar to the home.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The 2024 Nepali film ‘Boksi Ko Ghar’ starkly exposes the patriarchal oppression embedded in Nepal’s societal fabric portraying a rural woman accused of witchcraft and subjected to violence and ostracism. The film’s ending deliberately unresolved, underscores the never ending cycle of gendered marginalization.</p>\n<p>In Nepal sex workers are vilified, branded as immoral outcasts while the societal forces (can be told men), compelling their choices are conveniently ignored. Poverty, lack of property rights and abusive marriages often leave women with no alternative yet they bear the blame for surviving in a system stacked against them.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Men, whose desires sustain the trade escape scrutiny, their actions normalized as natural urges. Meanwhile sex workers are stripped of dignity, judged through a lens of patriarchal hypocrisy that demands female purity but excuses male indulgence. Of course there are exceptions let’s not argue about the minorities here.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As a group of friends, we ride scooters to college embracing the freedom of the open road only to face a barrage of gendered hostility. Boys on bikes taunt us, racing to overtake or jeering as if our driving is a spectacle, a “miracle” because we’re girls. My friend Aslesha, who drives a car endures this even more intensely.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Negative comments like “pakkai keti le chalayeko hunu parcha” follow her every mistake, real or perceived, especially when parking or navigating traffic. Such attitudes trap us in a cycle of scrutiny, undermining our confidence and right to move freely. To shed more light on this, in her book “Why Men Rape” Tara Kaushal recounts a man’s reaction as he teaches his wife to ride a scooter, he says, “dus saal pehle toh yeh aurat ghoonghat mein hoti, ghar se bahar nahi nikalti, aur ab scooter pe scooter chalayegi.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While Nepal&#8217;s constitution promises equality, our lived experiences tell a different story. This gap between legal promise and daily reality demands more than gradual cultural change, it requires decisive action.</p>\n<p>This fight is not about labels, it’s about humanity. We know the exhaustion of being dismissed, the weight of proving our worth in a world that assumes we are less. This isn’t just our battle, it’s a call for a society where no one’s dignity is mocked or sidelined. So laugh it off or roll your eyes but we are pushing for a world where empathy isn’t a miracle and equality isn’t a punch line.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As a law student, I understand that legislation alone cannot transform mindsets built over generations. But strong laws create protected spaces where new narratives can take root. We need courts that consistently reject &#8220;tradition&#8221; as justification for discrimination, harassment statutes that are actually enforced and media regulations that demand representation beyond stereotypes.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We must actively dismantle it, in our temples, our homes, our courts and our consciousness. Not gradually, not eventually, but now. Our daughters aren&#8217;t just inheriting our struggles, they are watching to see if we have the courage to end them. This isn&#8217;t merely about equality, it&#8217;s about reclaiming our collective humanity from a system that diminishes us all. The time for polite requests has passed. The time for transformation is here.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">(Writer is a third-year law student studying at Kathmandu School of Law.)</p>",

Suryakumar was fundamental with his sizzling 73* from 43 deliveries that lifted Mumbai to a competitive 180/5 on a Wankhede strip that wasn&#8217;t true to its high-scoring nature.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With Mitchell Santner and Jasprit Bumrah running rampant, Delhi never threatened to pose a challenge to Mumbai throughout their feeble attempts to stay alive in the playoffs. Moments after Mumbai&#8217;s victory lap, it rained cats and dogs at Wankhede. Suryakumar, with an umbrella in his hand, arrived at the presentation ceremony to accept his POTM award. He shared a heartwarming story that made his award &#8220;special&#8221;.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;It&#8217;s been 13 games now. My wife told me a sweet story today. She said you&#8217;ve got all the awards except MoM. This award is special today. From the team&#8217;s point of view, the knock was important, and also, this trophy is for her. She waits for such moments and we celebrate it obviously, looking forward to it,&#8221; Suryakumar said in the post-match presentation.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mumbai withered at 58/3 after losing its top-order in a cluster. Suyrakumar delivered a knock riddled with luck to change Mumbai&#8217;s fate. He stayed till the end, patiently waiting for the right moment to make DC bowlers perish and eventually found it in the last over.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Naman Dhir set the tempo for the explosive batter in the penultimate over. With his swashbuckling display, he reeled off two fours and as many sixes to garner 27 runs off Mukesh Kumar, who enjoyed a decent outing before that point.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Suryakumar was a walking nightmare for Dushmantha Chameera as he finished things off with two boundaries and the same number of sixes to lift Mumbai to a position of dominance. For the 34-year-old, Naman&#8217;s exploits in the 19th over and the energy that he &#8220;shared&#8221; with him were the turning point of the fixture.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;It was important for a single batter to bat till the end. We knew there was one over of 15-20 runs somewhere, so we had to wait till the end. The way Naman came in and shared that energy with me was also a turning point,&#8221; he concluded.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Following Mumbai&#8217;s win, the playoffs seats are confirmed with Royal Challengers Bengaluru, Gujarat Titans and Punjab Kings being the remaining three sides. The next group stage clashes will determine which spot these four sides will occupy in the standings before the playoffs. (ANI)</p>",

It said &#8220;Amidst these challenges, the Indian economy exhibited resilience. Various high frequency indicators of industrial and services sectors sustained their momentum in April&#8221;.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The report highlighted that persistent trade frictions, rising uncertainty in policymaking, and low consumer confidence are putting pressure on the world economy. Although a temporary pause in tariffs has provided some relief, the overall global outlook remains fragile.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It also added that the emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs), especially those in Asia, are expected to experience slower growth due to the impact of tariffs. Financial turbulence is also emerging as a key risk to global growth projections.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In contrast to this global uncertainty, India&#8217;s economy is showing strength. High-frequency indicators for both the industrial and services sectors maintained their momentum in April. The resilience is further reflected in record Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections during the month.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The agriculture sector is also expected to perform well. A bumper rabi harvest and higher planting for summer crops, along with favourable forecasts for the 2025 southwest monsoon, are positive signs for rural income and food production.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">RBI said &#8220;India continues to be an economy supported by stability- monetary, financial and political; policy consistency and certainty; congenial business environment; and strong macroeconomic fundamentals&#8221;.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Inflation trends are encouraging as well. Headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation fell for the sixth month in a row to reach its lowest level since July 2019. This decline was mainly due to a continued easing of food prices.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The report noted that domestic financial markets were under pressure in April, but saw a turnaround beginning in the third week of May.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the automobile sector, trends were mixed. Wholesale automobile sales fell 13.3 per cent year-on-year in April, mainly due to a high base effect that affected two-wheeler sales.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, tractor sales showed strong growth, though the pace slowed. Vehicle registrations rose 2.9 per cent year-on-year, with the transport segment seeing its highest growth in six months during April 2025.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Overall, the RBI report emphasized that as advanced economies struggle with economic uncertainty, India continues to stand out as a promising destination for long-term investors.

        "content": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"> WASHINGTON DC: US President Donald Trump, during a meeting at the White House on Wednesday (local time), confronted South African President Cyril Ramaphosa with unsubstantiated claims that white South Africans particularly Afrikaner farmers&#8211;are being systematically murdered, as reported by The Hill.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to The Hill, Trump&#8217;s administration has recently allowed Afrikaner farmers expedited access to refugee status and US citizenship, despite limited evidence supporting claims of targeted violence. This policy shift contrasts with the administration&#8217;s generally strict stance on immigration.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ramaphosa, a former anti-apartheid activist and freedom fighter, had responded to the claims diplomatically, countering Trump&#8217;s assertions. As per The Hill, at the meeting, Trump played a nearly four-minute video, reportedly shared by Afrikaner advocacy groups, which included inflammatory clips of Julius Malema, leader of South Africa&#8217;s Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party and cited him as a major threat and suggested Ramaphosa should have him arrested for inciting violence.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, Malema was expelled from the African National Congress years ago. Trump claimed that white farmers are having their land seized and are being killed, presenting news clippings he said proved escalating violence.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He also referred to a memorial of white crosses in South Africa&#8211;known as the Witkruis Monument&#8211;as a mass burial site for murdered white farmers, though the site is symbolic and commemorates victims of farm attacks regardless of race.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;It&#8217;s more than just a little movement &#8212; it&#8217;s a pretty big movement in South Africa,&#8221; Trump said of Malema&#8217;s Economic Freedom Fighters as quoted by The Hill. &#8220;Their land is being confiscated and, in many cases, they&#8217;re being killed,&#8221; Trump added.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ramaphosa refuted the genocide narrative, noting that Malema leads a small opposition party and is allowed to express his views under South Africa&#8217;s constitution. He emphasised that while crime is a problem in the country, it does not disproportionately affect white farmers.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;Our government policy is completely, completely against what you were saying, even in the Parliament,&#8221; the South African President said as quoted by The Hill. &#8220;They&#8217;re a small minority party which is allowed to exist, in terms of our constitution.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As per The Hill, Afrikaners&#8211;descendants of Dutch settlers&#8211;make up under 7 per cent of South Africa&#8217;s population but ruled the country during apartheid until 1994. Ramaphosa, who served under Nelson Mandela, became president in 2018 after a career in business and labour leadership.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">South Africa&#8217;s Parliament recently passed legislation to address historical injustices from apartheid, including land inequality. Though no land has been seized under the law, critics such as Elon Musk, who was present at the meeting, have used the reform to claim white South Africans are under threat. Musk has also said his company, Starlink, cannot operate in South Africa due to Black Economic Empowerment laws, as reported by The Hill.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As per The Hill, no international body has recognised the situation in South Africa as genocide. The country&#8217;s 2024 crime statistics show 6,032 murders, with only 44 occurring on farms and just one involving a farmer. The data does not specify victims&#8217; race. (ANI)</p>",

        "content": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">WASHINGTON DC: Following Pakistani federal cabinet approval to promote its Chief of Army Staff, General Asim Munir, to the rank of Field Marshal, former US National Security Advisor John Bolton expressed concern over the decision, calling it a &#8220;disturbing sign&#8221; that it could provide China with additional leverage in the region.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Speaking to ANI on Wednesday, Bolton highlighted the potential implications of the move, noting the continued hostility in the region that had hindered Pakistan&#8217;s development. He asserted for the US government&#8217;s involvement in the matter, else it could exacerbate internal dissent in the country.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;I think it&#8217;s potentially a disturbing sign. Obviously, internal dissent in Pakistan is repressed. Imran Khan remains in prison. I ultimately don&#8217;t think this is in Pakistan&#8217;s own interest. This is something the US government should press on them. The continued level of hostility here is just going to impede Pakistan&#8217;s development, as it has for many years already,&#8221; Bolton said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;But it worries me that it is another opportunity for the Chinese to take advantage of these developments that gives them additional leverage inside Pakistan,&#8221; he added. Earlier, in a move widely viewed as an attempt to mask recent military and strategic failures, the Pakistani federal cabinet on Tuesday approved the promotion of Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir to Field Marshal.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The government cited his leadership during Operation Bunyanum Marsoos and the confrontation with India, labelled Marka-i-Haq, as grounds for the honour, Dawn reported. Despite the military setbacks, Pakistan&#8217;s government is projecting the outcome as a &#8220;historic victory&#8221;, praising General Munir&#8217;s leadership during the conflict.<br />\nGeneral Asim Munir became only the second army officer in Pakistan&#8217;s history to be elevated to Field Marshal.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ayub Khan, Pakistan&#8217;s president from 1958 to 1969, holds the distinction of being the country&#8217;s first Field Marshal. Notably, his promotion to this highest military rank was self-appointed, following his coup and assuming the presidency in 1958.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A year later, in 1959, Khan awarded himself the Field Marshal rank, citing &#8220;persistent requests&#8221; from Pakistani civil society members, just before his scheduled retirement from the army. Munir&#8217;s elevation also signals who truly calls the shots in Pakistan. The government approved a promotion that further cements the army chief&#8217;s dominance over the country&#8217;s civilian leadership.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Notably, even General Pervez Musharraf, despite holding absolute power for years, never assumed the title. The position of field marshal is symbolic but permanent, with no retirement, and held until death. The promotion comes just weeks after India launched Operation Sindoor, a high-impact counter-terror operation in response to the deadly April 22 Pahalgam attack.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The operation exposed Pakistan&#8217;s inability to shield its territory and airspace from precise Indian strikes, which destroyed critical infrastructure and eliminated dozens of terrorists. Despite this, Pakistan&#8217;s top civilian and military leadership now projects the outcome as a &#8220;historic victory.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">General Munir&#8217;s promotion is seen as an attempt to bolster his position and mask Pakistan&#8217;s recent military setbacks.

For her second outing at the festival, she made a bold fashion statement in a custom creation by designer Gaurav Gupta.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The ensemble featured a striking black shimmer gown accompanied by a voluminous white cape. The Banarasi brocade cape was handwoven in Varanasi. The cape stood out not just for its rich texture but also because it was inscribed with a Sanskrit shloka from the Bhagavad Gita.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Meanwhile, Aishwarya was last seen in &#8216;Ponniyin Selvan: II&#8217; (2023), directed by Mani Ratnam, where she starred alongside a stellar cast including Vikram, Karthi, Trisha Krishnan, and Sobhita Dhulipala.

Speaking about his administration&#8217;s decision to bar Harvard University from enrolling international students, Trump said, &#8220;Billions of dollars have been paid to Harvard.

While the directive—to regulate the printing and labeling of health warnings on tobacco packets, wrappers, strips, and parcels—seems beneficial from a public awareness perspective, business insiders argue that it might inadvertently promote the illegal trade of tobacco in Nepal.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>New Private Sector Members to Join Investment Board: </strong>New members from the private sector are set to be appointed to the Investment Board. With the departure of Bhawani Rana, Haribhakta Sharma, and Rajeshkaji Shrestha, new appointments will be made. The Board stated that their term has ended and the chairperson will appoint their replacements. “Their tenure has expired,” said Yuvraj Khatiwada, joint spokesperson of the Board. “Now, the chairperson will appoint new members.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>NEA Removes CEO Bimal Gurung from Dudhkoshi Hydropower Project: </strong>The Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) has removed Bimal Gurung, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the 670-megawatt Dudhkoshi Reservoir Hydropower Project, from his position. Gurung, who was working under NEA&#8217;s subsidiary company overseeing the Dudhkoshi project, was officially recalled to the central office on Wednesday. A formal letter was issued by the authority directing him to report to the Engineering Services Directorate’s Division of Norms, Specifications, and Design.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Agricultural Lending Rises Slightly by 1.6% in Nine Months: </strong>Agricultural lending in Nepal increased by just 1.6% over the first nine months of the current fiscal year—a marginal rise compared to 0.7% growth during the same period last year. In FY 2079/80, agricultural lending had declined by 2.3% over the same timeframe. According to Nepal Rastra Bank, loans to the agricultural sector reached Rs 425.23 billion by the end of Chaitra (mid-April), compared to Rs 418.59 billion at the end of Ashad (mid-July), showing a 1.6% increase.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>FNCCI President Calls for Tourism Infrastructure and Connectivity: </strong>Chandra Prasad Dhakal, President of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI), has called for improved tourism infrastructure and connectivity. Speaking at the opening of the Third Buddhist International Travel Mart in Kathmandu—organized by the Nepal Tourism Board and Nepal Association of Tour and Travel Agents (NATTA) with support from the Ministry of Culture, Tourism, and Civil Aviation—he emphasized the need to enhance Nepal&#8217;s capacity to attract tourists.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Nepal Securities Board Approves IPO for Himstar Energy Company: </strong>Nepal Securities Board has granted approval to Him Star Energy Company for issuing an Initial Public Offering (IPO). The company has received permission to publish a prospectus for the issuance of a total of 1,199,000 shares. NIC Asia Capital will act as the share issuance and sales manager for Himstar Energy’s IPO.

After completing the IPO allotment for locals of the project-affected area and Nepalis working abroad, the company has now issued shares to the general public. The company has offered 2,415,300 shares worth Rs 241.53 million at a face value of Rs 100 per share.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Technical Glitch Hits E-Sewa, Sparks Public Confusion: </strong>A technical issue occurred in the digital payment service provider E-Sewa on Monday afternoon. Many users reported being unable to log in to the mobile app or website, and those who could log in faced problems in processing transactions. The incident sparked widespread discussion, criticism, and speculation on social media. Some users even fell victim to misleading claims that E-Sewa had been hacked or that its security was compromised, according to the company.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Sikta Irrigation Project Begins Branch Canal Construction: </strong>The under-construction Sikta Irrigation Project in Banke has started building a branch canal from its eastern main canal. As water is already flowing in parts of the eastern main canal, branch construction has begun to deliver water directly to farmlands, said project director Raju Acharya. According to him, work has started from Lataniya village in Rapti Sonari Rural Municipality–4. The branch canal will be 4 kilometers long, with sub-branches extending from 1.4 kilometers. Three sub-branch canals are planned in this segment.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Dangerous Sections of Karnali Highway Remain Unimproved: </strong>Despite the start of upgrades on the Karnali Highway—considered the backbone of Karnali&#8217;s economic and physical development—hazardous sections remain unimproved. The Jumla-Kalikot stretch of the 232 km Jumla-Surkhet road includes spots like Timure, Bhainsigauda, Bhigim, and Takulla, which remain full of potholes, hampering daily transport. The condition of the Paduka River area between Tallodungeshwar and Paltada in Dailekh is also poor. In winter, dust clouds reduce visibility; in the rainy season, vehicles get stuck in the mud.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Plastic Waste Being Turned into Tiles and Bricks in Dang: </strong>In Dang, a joint effort between local government and the private sector has started producing tiles and interlocking bricks from plastic waste. These bricks are typically used for parking areas, footpaths, and courtyards. The project is a collaboration between Rapti Rural Municipality and Eco Family, based in Hetauda. The facility also produces plastic water tanks. According to Eco Family Pvt. Ltd., this is the first such production initiative in the country.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Harmful Levels of Pesticide Residue Found in Vegetables in Kanchanpur: </strong>Harmful levels of pesticide residue have been found in vegetables in Kanchanpur. A team from the Pesticide Residue Rapid Analysis Laboratory Unit Office in Attariya, Kailali, collected vegetable samples for lab testing and found some containing pesticide levels unsuitable for consumption. According to Assistant Technician Rajendra Prasad Bhatt from the unit office, among 10 vegetable samples collected from six shops at Jhulari Bazaar, Shuklaphanta Municipality–10, bitter gourd was found to have pesticide levels unfit for consumption.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Gold Price Drops by Rs 1,100 Per Tola on Friday: </strong>The price of gold has decreased by Rs 1,100 per tola on Friday.

I know people, and hopefully, they will understand the beauty behind that script&#8211;the love for a girl, the girl&#8217;s acceptance of a parent&#8217;s choice, and then living up to that, along with the ever-so-loving husband, Ram,&#8221; said the actor.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;You know, that&#8217;s relationships at their peak. Today, marriages snap just like this because kids are upset with each other. I think that just shows what our culture is all about and how it needs to be. We need to start believing in each other and believing that love exists. And that is what Dhadkan is all about,&#8221; Shetty added.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The film, directed by Dharmesh Darshan, featured Akshay Kumar, Shilpa Shetty, and Suniel Shetty in key roles. Its plot, revolving around a love triangle, touched many hearts at the time of its release and continues to be loved by fans to this day.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Apart from its strong story and performances, Dhadkan became a huge success due to its music. The soundtrack, composed by the hit duo Nadeem-Shravan, included chartbusters like Tum Dil Ki Dhadkan Mein, Dil Ne Yeh Kaha Hai Dil Se, and Na Na Karte.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On the work front, Suniel Shetty will next be seen in the film Kesari Veer: Legends of Somnath, which also stars Sooraj Pancholi and is also set to release on May 23.

He described it as a “relatively new but vital concept,” adding that it is a problem-solving form of diplomacy rooted in four key pillars: collaboration, trust-building, capacity deployment, and addressing challenges.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Former Minister Ganesh Shah, the chief guest of the program, emphasized the importance of Nepal adopting modern instruments of international cooperation, including science diplomacy, to tackle the challenges of the 21st century. Highlighting the current state of Nepal’s foreign relations, Shah remarked, “Our international relations have grown weaker than before; therefore, Nepal seriously needs to embrace science diplomacy.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Former Nepali Ambassador to Spain and Oman, Dr. Sarmila Parajuli Dhakal, said Nepal is significantly lagging behind in science diplomacy and emphasized that it is high time the country takes the matter seriously.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She stressed the urgent need for coordinated efforts to integrate science into foreign policy and global collaboration.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">During the same talk program organized by the Center for Diplomacy and Development, veteran climber Phurba Tenzing Sherpa and Raj Gurung were felicitated for their recent success in summiting Mount Everest. Sherpa, who reached the world’s highest peak for the 17th time, and Gurung, the first Nepali-origin resident of Hong Kong to scale Everest, were honored for their remarkable achievements.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-159531\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/d139003e-5d13-4c94-85d2-cd7934367838.jpg\" width=\"1600\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The event highlighted how exchange of scientific knowledge, technology, and innovation between nations could enhance both domestic development and global solidarity—particularly if guided by diplomatic cooperation.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Participants agreed that Nepal must foster dialogue between scientists and diplomats, establish platforms for cross-border research cooperation, and invest in scientific education and policy frameworks to benefit from science diplomacy.</p>",

        "content": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">KATHMANDU: In his 1784 essay <em>What is Enlightenment, </em>Immanuel Kant argued that intellectual and political immaturity was a self-imposed condition, arising from a lack of courage to use one’s own understanding and to step out of dependency on others.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In Nepal, where institutional power is mostly exercised by legal exceptions and elite bargains, policymaking has become reflective of an 18th century adage.  People and both provincial and federal parliaments seem to have normalized policy corruption for lacking courage and restricting themselves in serving their political masters at the top. Rendering cabinet decisions immune at birth, Nepal’s political elite have literally locked citizens out of a meaningful public participation—turning them again into subjects instead of makers and shapers of public policy.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At this critical moment, Nepal is presented with a rare opportunity. There is a chance to amend the long overdue CIAA Act, which is under discussion in Parliament. First drafted six years ago, the amendment was revised and passed by the National Assembly (NA) two years ago. The amendment bill, however, instead of addressing the prime reason for corruption has not only retained the privilege in the federal context but also extended it to the provinces.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Article 4(1) of the <em>CIAA Act of 1991</em> explicitly exempts Cabinet’s “policy decisions” from CIAA investigation. It is also unclear what constitutes policy decisions. Unlike petty corruption—which includes bribery, procurement fraud, or bureaucratic extortion—policy corruption operates within the formal mechanisms of governance. They are often asserted as lawful.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The National Assembly (NA), in simple terms, recommended that certain types of policy decisions—other than those relating to larger public interest—should be subject to scrutiny by the CIAA. The proposal was then forwarded to the House of Representatives, where a subcommittee of the Committee on State Affairs and Good Governance reviewed it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While the lower house primarily updates the CIAA’s mandate in line with federal restructuring, it also addressed a long-standing legal gap to a larger extent: the immunity granted to Cabinet-level “policy decisions.” The amendment recommends that certain decisions, including those related to public procurement (with some exceptions) and decisions normally under the jurisdiction of other public officials, such as bureaucrats, should fall under the CIAA’s jurisdiction. Furthermore, it suggests that decisions directly benefiting specific individuals or private/business interests—subject to certain conditions—should be open to investigation.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The existing provision’s impact is evident in several major cases. In the infamous scandals such as the Lalita Niwas-land-grab and the procurement of wide-body aircraft, only bureaucrats and middlemen faced judicial proceedings, while cabinet members who authorized the decisions remain unscathed to this date. Some prime ministers were excused by the same anti-graft body (despite the supreme court order to the contrary) that was supposed to take the corrupt to justice.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The same pattern can be seen in infrastructure projects such as the international airports in Pokhara and Bhairawa. Such projects moved forward through cabinet decisions despite having technical and financial concerns. Similarly, the disbursement of Maoist-era guerrilla allowances and the leasing of valuable Nepal Trust properties at lower rates have raised serious concerns. In each case, Cabinet decisions served as the legal shield, placing the transactions outside CIAA jurisdiction stalling democratic accountability.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is now known that the Parliamentary sub-committee has already submitted its report. Now the bill rests with the Committee chair, and it is unlikely to see the light of day with recommended changes. It is not difficult to guess that this has been done in the direction of topmost leaders from the ruling parties.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">They see the expanded jurisdiction of the CIAA a threat and therefore exerted pressure to ensure the amended provisions do not advance. Procedural delays and suppression of the bills have been the hallmark of how parliamentary committees function these days.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the meantime, Nepal’s institutional credibility continues to erode. Transparency International’s corruption indices remain poor, especially in areas such as procurement and infrastructure. Journalists and watchdog groups consistently trace irregularities to Cabinet decisions that channel benefits specific political and business interests. As former Supreme Court Justice Ishwor Khatiwada has observed, shielding Cabinet decisions from scrutiny creates a systemic blind spot—one that undermines the entire architecture of public accountability.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Nepal now stands at a pivotal juncture. The amendment to the CIAA Act offers a rare window to restore institutional legitimacy. Our international reputation is also at stake as FATF’s has put Nepal in the grey list, which is alarming. The challenge before us is also a moral one: will Nepal remain a polity where public interest is subordinated to elite consensus for private purposes? I believe we can certainly take a step toward transforming this nation where citizens are not just subjects, but are empowered to understand, question, and participate in the making of the law, and parliament reciprocates to their constituencies.</p>\n<p><strong>(Neha Pokharel is interested in political economy.)</strong></p>",
